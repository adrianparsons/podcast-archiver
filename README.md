# Podcast Archiver

This is a simple script that, given an RSS feed, will download audio episodes for a given show.

Example:

`./archiver.py https://feeds.simplecast.com/o4jAFXaw`

Creates a folder in the working directory and downloads the first two episodes of the podcast.

`./archiver.py --help` for all options
